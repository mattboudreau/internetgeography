    <h1>Tree Count in NYC Over The Years</h1>

    <p>As I was walking in the East River Park watching the construction happen, I noticed many healthy trees being torn down for this construction. Because of this, I wanted to see what the evolution in tree count has been in the city by graphing and mapping data from the Tree Census.
    The City of New York has taken a big initiative since the 90's to increase tree count in the city. This data looks strictly at tree count from the tree census which looks at tree count on the streets, which excludeds trees in areas like parks or natural forested areas.</p>

  <p>This project allowed me to create a visual analysis on data that I was genuinely curious about. It is one thing to see numbers changing over time, but creating a visual narrative with those numbers created a much more compelling story. I found that being able to compare the charts to the maps back to back allows for you to see how that information which is expressed in the charts manifests in a real landscape. I chose the stacked bar charts to visualize the tree census information because I felt it most clearly represented the relationship in the amount of trees between each borough. I wanted to specifically show the difference in number between each borough because I think it is important for context. It allowed for me to see very surpirising information like Manhattan having the least amount of trees in each borough and being able to see which boroughs increased in trees the most. The bars give this relationship a sort of scale and allows you to see this relationship between boroughs much more visually. I think the most beneficial part of storytelling in this way is that it can be applied to so many important topics with datasets that are widely available. Something like tree expansion over time is something that you wouldn't necessarily think to be improving in recent history but through these datasets you are able to see a type of information that otherwise feels hidden. Also the fact that this information is so widely accessible to the public for free can be super beneficial to storytellers and artists that are looking to back up what they want to express with real information. I think these resources are things that I will take with me to show my research analysis for future projects and hopefully incorporate into visualizations for my research based projects.</p>
